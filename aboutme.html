                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello! I'm Son Vu, also known as Lucas. I'm a dedicated and versatile IT professional with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and creating meaningful solutions through software development. My journey in IT has been an exciting blend of self-driven exploration and hands-on experience, enhanced by a diverse background in both business and technology.</p>

            <section id="bg-work" class="mt-5">
                <h2>Background & Work Experience</h2>
                <p>With over two years of experience working in the IT industry, I've worn multiple hats across various projects. My career started in the Finance and Banking sector, where I worked for four years, gaining in-depth knowledge of financial processes and understanding the client's perspective. Following this, I moved into the Air Ticketing industry, spending two years contributing to projects focused on flight booking and reservation systems, which gave me valuable domain experience in travel technology.

                    I’ve taken on roles that span from full-stack development to product management, which has allowed me to be actively involved in various facets of software development. For instance, I’ve worked as a Full-Stack Web Developer for E9pay, spearheading the development of a terminal application using a mix of technologies like Flask, Python, and JavaScript. I've also played a key role as Product Manager for the E9pay Mobile App, focusing on improving user experience and adding innovative features to make the app more competitive.</p>

            <section id="tech-skill" class="mt-5">
                <h2>Technical Skills</h2>
                <p>My technical expertise lies primarily in Python, Java, and JavaScript, but I also have experience with Flutter and Dart for cross-platform app development. In the front-end development landscape, I am comfortable with technologies like HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I’ve worked extensively with Python for three years, contributing to numerous projects and honing my skills in backend development and automation. My experience in Java, though relatively new, includes project-based work on full-stack applications, which has helped me understand core concepts in a practical environment.

                    I have also led and worked on complex API integrations, especially in SOAP-based systems such as the Travelport and KAOAPI, combining efforts from both back-end and front-end to deliver seamless user interfaces. Additionally, my recent experience includes leading a TypeScript front-end project named 'ksdashboard-fe', where I'm working on translating an existing JavaScript codebase to TypeScript.</p>

            <section id="bg-edu" class="mt-5">
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I hold a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, which I completed in 2018. This business foundation has been highly beneficial as I transitioned into IT, allowing me to merge my understanding of market needs with technical know-how. I also have an MBA, which further bolsters my understanding of strategic business decisions and effective project management. Alongside formal education, I’ve been actively studying and working on IT projects for the past two years, furthering my skills and learning hands-on.

                    I have also invested in various certifications that align with my career goals. I completed a Java Full Stack Development certification from Board Infinity, a Database Management Systems certification from Korea IT, and a Front-end Development certification from Meta. These courses have strengthened my technical abilities and introduced me to best practices that are essential in the industry.</p>

                <h2>Language Proficiency & Certifications</h2>
                <p>I’m proficient in Vietnamese, English, and Korean, which has helped me work in diverse teams and communicate effectively with a broad client base. My language certifications include TOPIK 4 for Korean and an IELTS score of 7.5 for English proficiency.</p>

                <h2>Long-term Goals</h2>
                <p>Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to establish myself as a Full-stack Developer, working with Java, Python, JavaScript (NodeJS), or Flutter. I want to contribute to projects that challenge my creativity and technical skills while enabling me to grow professionally. I am excited about working on solutions that bridge technology with user needs, and I'm committed to making an impact through innovative software.</p>

                <h2>Personal Touch</h2>
                <p>When I'm not coding or managing projects, I enjoy a good cup of coffee—it's a daily ritual that keeps me going. I also enjoy exploring new technologies, constantly learning, and growing my skillset to stay current in this fast-evolving field. Apart from coffee, I love music—particularly bands like Keane, Snow Patrol, and Coldplay. I also have a passion for astronomy and horoscopes, and my all time favorite movie (as of now) is Interstellar.</p>
